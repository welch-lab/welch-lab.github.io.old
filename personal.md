<p>When not working on research, I enjoy training for triathlons. My favorite thing about triathlons is that swimming, running, and biking provide a nice variety of workouts and a great way to enjoy the outdoors.</p>

 <p>I also love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0CWYISXO8k">playing classical music</a> on the piano (see below for some of my recordings) and regularly assist with music at my <a href="https://knoxannarbor.org/">church</a>.</p>
